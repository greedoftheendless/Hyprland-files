# Greed's Hyprland Dotfiles

Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my Hyprland rice. Initially, I designed this with a **Catppuccin theme** in mind but later tweaked it to give it a more **cyberpunk-inspired vibe**.

My main goal was to create a setup that's **clean, attractive, and minimalistic** ‚Äî something you can truly use on your daily driver without overwhelming animations or distractions. It‚Äôs designed to be simple and functional while still being aesthetically pleasing.

If you like what you see, please consider **starring the repository**! Your support motivates me to improve it and add even more useful features.

Have a tweak or improvement in mind? Feel free to **submit a pull request**. If it aligns with the theme, I'll happily merge it. If not, I'll explain the reasoning behind the decision.

Enjoy your OS.

## üõ† Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This setup is intended for **Nix-OS**. Proceed only if you know what you are doing!
                Due to the declarative nature of Nix, if you follow the steps below, you will get the exact copy of my system.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [The repo ur in](https://github.com/greedoftheendless/Hyprland-files)

### 2. Move these specific files to their locations
    
    .All the configurations such as Picom, Kitty etc... in ~/.config or $HOME/.config
    .The Hyprland config file in ~/.config/hypr or $HOME/.config/hypr
    .The Nix-config folder contents(3 or more files) in /etc/nixos
    .flake.nix and flake.lock in /etc/nixos

### 3. Re-build your system
    Rebuild your system using the following command

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch


üìö Notes

    Wallpapers are managed by Waypaper, utilizing swww and mpvpaper as the engine/backend.

    Notifications are handled by Sway Notifications Control (Swaync).

    Audio is managed through pavucontrol and wpctl.

    The lock screen uses Hyprpanel with a music player widget (currently under development) and customized theming.

    Autostart applications and scripts are configured within Hyprland's autostart.conf. These can be configured/changed in $HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf under the exec = line.

    Scratchpads are configured for quick access to terminals, music, notes, etc.

    Waybar is highly modular and supports various modules like battery, Wi-Fi, media player, and more.
