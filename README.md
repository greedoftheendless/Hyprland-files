# Greed's Hyprland Dotfiles

Welcome! This repository contains my personal Nix OS configuration using Niri(Main) and Hyprland, designed for a clean and efficient workspace.

Initially crafted with a **Catppuccin theme**, I've since refined it to a more **cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic**. The goal was a setup that's **clean, attractive, and minimalistic**, perfect for a daily driver without unnecessary animations or distractions.

If you find this useful, please consider **starring the repository**!

Have an idea for a tweak or an improvement? Feel free to **submit a pull request**.
Enjoy your Nixified OS!

### üõ† Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This setup is intended for **NixOS**. Due to the declarative nature of Nix, following these steps will give you an exact copy of my system.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/greedoftheendless/Hyprland-files](https://github.com/greedoftheendless/Hyprland-files)

### 2. Prepare the dotfiles
Place the contents of the cloned repository into a folder of your choice (e.g., `~/dotfiles`).

### 3. Things to remember before running the implementation command
Make sure that the duplicate Nix folder in /etc/nixos is deleted. To make this operation work smoothly, make sure to symlink all the folders in dotfiles/.config to ~/.config, and symlink the folder dotfiles/nixos to /etc/nixos so that in the future when you make any changes or any config changes there wont be any issues.

### 4. Rebuild your system

Rebuild your system using the following command to apply the configuration.

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch

## üìö Notes & Integrations

* **Wallpapers:** Managed by `Waypaper`, utilizing `swww` and `mpvpaper` as the engine.
* **Notifications:** Handled by Sway Notifications Control (`Swaync`).
* **Audio:** Managed through `pavucontrol` and `wpctl`.
* **Lock Screen:** Uses `Hyprlock` with a music player widget (currently under development, shutdown, lock, sleep options, and custom theming.
* **Auto-Start:** Configured in `$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` under the `exec` lines and in the confifuration file of ~/.config/niri.
* **Scratchpads(For Hyprland):** Configured for quick access to terminals, music, and notes.
* **NVIDIA Drivers:** Installed with the latest NVIDIA drivers and AMD drivers. Please change the configuration accordingly. If yours is RTX series, then works.  
* **Waybar:** Highly modular, supporting various modules for battery, Wi-Fi, media players, and more.
* **Rofi/Vicinae:** Rofi is having basic features such as application search, SSH connections, and terminal tool+file selection. All of this is also possible with Vicinae and more. Check Vicinaes documentation for that here, https://docs.vicinae.com .

* Hyprland Wiki
* r/unixporn

### üìù To-Do List

* Create a Bash script to automate the installation process for non-NixOS users.
* Change from making .config files to making all configurations in the Nix Language so it will be easier to implement for the nix users

**Stay hungry, stay foolish. Keep customizing!**
