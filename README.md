# Greed's Hyprland Dotfiles

Welcome! This repository contains my personal Hyprland configuration, designed for a clean and efficient workspace.

Initially crafted with a **Catppuccin theme**, I've since refined it to a more **cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic**. The goal was a setup that's **clean, attractive, and minimalistic**, perfect for a daily driver without unnecessary animations or distractions.

If you find this useful, please consider **starring the repository**! Your support is a huge motivator.

Have an idea for a tweak or an improvement? Feel free to **submit a pull request**. If it aligns with the theme, I'll happily merge it.

Enjoy your OS!
